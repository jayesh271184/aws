EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud
	- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud is a part of Amazon.com's cloud-computing platform, AWS,
	that allows users to rent virtual computers on which to run their own computer applications.
An AWS EC2 Instance is nothing but a server in the cloud. Just like your physical server,
 it comes with varying specs for compute, memory, networking, and storage.

EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud is a part of Amazon.com's cloud-computing 
	platform, AWS, that allows users to rent virtual computers on which to run their own computer applications.
	- An AWS EC2 Instance is nothing but a server in the cloud. Just like your physical server, it comes with
	  varying specs for compute, memory, networking, and storage.
    - EC2 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
    - It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2's simple web service 
	  interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction.
    - EC2 provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. You can use Amazon EC2 
	  to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage.

EC2 Purchasing Option:- Four Type
 1. On Demand Instance
 2. Reserved Instance
 3. Spot Instance
 4. Dedicated Instance
 
1. On Demand Instance -
				We have to pay only we use(Jitne hours use kiya uska charge dena hai)
				
2. Reserved Instance - Purchase for 1 or 3 year,If we use or not but we give charge for 
   1 or 3 year (Use kre k nhi uske 1 or 3 year ka charge pay krna hi hai). In comparison to On-demand charge less.
   Provide significant discount upto 72% compared to on-demand instance prise.
   In Reserved instance Bidding AWS if not in use.
   
   Standard Reserved Instances provide you with a significant discount (up to 72%) compared to On-Demand Instance 
   pricing, and can be purchased for a 1-year or 3-year term. Customers have the flexibility to change the 
   Availability Zone, the instance size, and networking type of their Standard Reserved Instances.

   Purchase Convertible Reserved Instances if you need additional flexibility, such as the ability to use different
   instance families, operating systems, or tenancies over the Reserved Instance term. Convertible Reserved 
   Instances provide you with a significant discount (up to 54%) compared to On-Demand Instances and can be purchased
   for a 1-year or 3-year term.
	
	Two Type of Plan for this
	1. 1 year plan
		- Standard
		- convertible
    2. 2 year Plan
		- Standard
		- convertible
3. Spot Instance -
			- AWS Bidding its Reserved Instance If User not Work currently 
			- Its Call Bidding,AWS Bidding its server Max 6 Hours Use Resource after six hours 2nd time bidding for Instance
			- Bidding for instance per hours.
			- Costing is Less Compare to on Demand, upto 90% Discount in Comparison to on demand.
			- If AWS has getting highest bidding any other user then current user work stop in between his work progress has been lost 
			  instance align to new bidding user.
			- In Between this Reserved instance Main User who purchase this reserved instance his work Restart then 
			  all bidding user work stop and lost his all data
				(Current user se jyade kisine boli laga di to current user ka kam bich me bandh kr k new user jisne boli jyada
				lagai usko mil jayega aur current user ka work lost ho jayega in Between this Reserved instance Main User who purchase this reserved instance his work Start then all bidding user work stop and lost his all data).
			- It can use for Testing purpose.

4. Dedicated Instance - 
			- Purchase for 1 or 3 year,If we use or not but we give charge for 1 or 3 year (Use kre k nhi uske 1 or 3 year ka charge pay krna hi hai)

EC2 Instance Type -Its Also Call Family (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)
1. General Purpose
2. Memory Optimized
3. Compute Optimized
4. Accelerated Compute
5. Storage Optimized

   If we Purchase Dedicated instance then its type is ".metal" Ex. c5.metal
   
1. General Purpose - General purpose instances provide a balance of compute, memory and networking resources,
       and can be used for a variety of diverse workloads.
	   - These instances are ideal for applications that use these resources in equal proportions such as web 
	   servers and code repositories. 
	   - It can Provide Multiple Instance Type With Different Type of Memory CPU etc
 Use Case :- Scale-out workloads such as web servers, containerized microservices, caching fleets, and distributed 
 data stores, as well as development environments
 
2. Compute Optimized - It can Max. use where we have require "High performance ".
	   - Compute Optimized instances are ideal for compute bound applications that benefit from high performance processors.
	   - Use for ( Instances belonging to this family are well suited for) batch processing workloads, media transcoding, 
	   high performance web servers, high performance computing (HPC), scientific modeling, dedicated gaming servers
	   and ad server engines, machine learning inference and other compute intensive applications.
	   - It can Provide Compute power High that means "Virtual CPU(vCPU) Jyada milta hai"
 Use Case :- High performance web servers, scientific modelling, batch processing, distributed analytics, high-performance 
 computing (HPC), machine/deep learning inference, ad serving, highly scalable multiplayer gaming, and video encoding.
 
3. Memory Optimized - Use for to "Deliver fast performance "for workloads
	  - Memory optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data
	  sets in memory.
	  - "It can Provide Max RAM "
 Use Case :- R5 instances are well suited for memory intensive applications such as high performance databases, 
 distributed web scale in-memory caches, mid-size in-memory databases, real time big data analytics, and other 
 enterprise applications.
 
4. Accelerated Compute - Attach GPU then It can work fast
	  - Accelerated computing instances use hardware accelerators, or co-processors, to perform functions,
	  - Use such as floating point number calculations, graphics processing, or data pattern matching, more 
	  efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs.
	  - "If we require fast output with High performance" at that time we have use(Used at NASA,ISRO).
 Use Case :- Machine/Deep learning, high performance computing, computational fluid dynamics, computational 
 finance, seismic analysis, speech recognition, autonomous vehicles, drug discovery.

5. Storage Optimized - It can "use where Large amount of storage Size required" 
	  - Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write
	  access to very large data sets on local storage.
	  - They are optimized to deliver tens of thousands of low-latency, random I/O operations per second (IOPS)
	  to applications.
 Use Case :- NoSQL databases (e.g. Cassandra, MongoDB, Redis), in-memory databases (e.g. Aerospike), scale-out 
 transactional databases, data warehousing, Elasticsearch, analytics workloads.
 
 
Placement Group - If we use Multiple Instance then use this. It can show at max. level to found where my server mount. Find Max. level not perferct level
1. Spread
2. Cluster
3. Partition

  1. Spread - It can mount multiple instance at different Zone.
	- If We use 2 Server(Instance) then both Instance Mount at different Zone then If any of the Zone has get any Issue 
	at that time our work will be continue with the help of another instance, But Latency will be increase
	- If we launch Instance then it can mount any where in zone,It can not mount at particuler zone.
	- Advantages - Data secure bcz Both Locate different Location,If one Zone get down then work from another zone.
	- Disadvantage - If both Server inter communicate at that time latency normally high
  2. Cluster - It can mount in Single zone and single rack.
    - In single Rack multiple Instance Lunch
    - Advantages - Communication fast latency low
	- Disadvantage - If any issue in Rack then all instance Down(Full Server Down)
	- We have to create max 100 Cluster,In 1 Cluster max 7 instance mount
  3. Partition - Lunch instance in Single zone,Multiple Rack
	- Advantages - If one Rack Down then work continue with another rack, Latency Low Compare to Spread
	- Disadvantage - If Zone Down then Full Setup Down(Work Stop)
	
	
Maximum we have to use Spread Bcz It is secure,If one zone down then work from another zone

EBS (Elastic Block storage)- 
	EBS has mulitple Type
	EBS Type Divide into 2 Types
		1. IOPS(Input output per second) - How many Read/write operation Perform in second
		2. Throughput - Single operation Size
		
		
		
Type :-
1. SSD (Solid State Drive)
2. HDD (Hard Disk Drive)
3. Magnetic	
	`
1. SSD (Solid State Drive)
		SSD Speed is Faster then HDD & Magnetic.
		2 Type. 
			1. gp2 (General Purpose)
					IOPS - Upto 16000 = in 1 second we perform Max 16000 operation
					Throughput - 250 mb = 1 operation size is 250 mb
								It can provide 3906 gb/s speed provide
			2. io1 (Provisioned IOPS)
					IOPS - Up to 64000 = in 1 second we perform Max 64000 operation (3 Times higher then gp2)
					Throughput - 1000 mb = 1 operation size is 1000 mb
								It can provide 61000 gb/s speed provide
2. HDD (Hard Disk Drive) 
		2 Type.
			1. st1 (Throughput optimized)
					IOPS - Up to 500 = in 1 second we perform Max 500 operation 
					Throughput - 500 mb = 1 operation size is 500 mb
					can not be used at boot volume
					
			2. sc1 (Cold Hdd) - It is very cheapest in all four
					IOPS - Up to 250 = in 1 second we perform Max 250 operation
					Throughput - 250 mb = 1 operation size is 250 mb
					can not be used at boot volume
					
3. Magnetic	
		1 Type
			1. std
					IOPS - 40-200 = in 1 second we perform Max 40-200 operation
					Throughput - 50-90 mb = 1 operation size is 50-90 mb
	
	Here we have use 3 volume as boot volume (Means Operating system add ,At time of machine create require some space at time we have use this below Jaha par hmari operating related file padi hai,Jaha pr hum Operating System Install kr rahe hai)
			1. gp2		2.io1		3. Magnetic	
	 
	At time of Instance Create Max Size is 1023 Gib
	
	If We use volume and any work in this volume,after work done if volume detach and attach other instance But our data is safe we have show our data.
	We have increase Volume size after create volume. Action -> Modify volume -> change Size of volume.
	Single Volume for Single Machine
	After Volume create & Attach 1st we have to format this volume and mount volume then use it.
	In Linux
	mkfs.xfs /dev/sda(Volume name)
	mount /dev/sda	/chintan (Mount Point)  - Mount the Volume then we have use it.
	
		
Volume Create - 
	Go to Volume
	Create volume select
	Select Volume type,Size,AZ,Snapshot Id(Not mendotory),Add tag 
	Create Volume.
	
	At time Volume Create We have must select those availibilty zone Where instance Create on Zone(Jis zone me Instance Create kiya hai usme hi Volume create Krna hai)

Volume Attach - Volume Attach after instance Create or if Any Instance terminate & We have to retrive data from this volume then we use
	Select Volume
	Actions -> attach volume -> Select Instance
	
Volume Detach - Volume not in use at Instance then detach volume
	Select Volume
	Actions -> detach volume -> yes,detach
	
 
AMI 
	We have to create AMI our OWN with the help of Instance
	It can be use at time we have to create instance with same configuration at that time we have use this type of ISO AMI.
	It can use at Auto scalable Future,If we create new AMI with Existing feature at night so we have directly create it.
	
How to Create AMI - 
    Select Instance
	go to Action
	select Image -> Create Image 
	Type Image Name
	Type Image Discription
	Create Image
	
How to Check AMI
	Images -> AMIS
	Image Only One Create & Volume is How Many Volume Use in Instance Is Create (Like if 2 volume use in Instance then
	1 AMI Create & 2 Volume Create) Volume Also Called "Snapshot"
	If we try to Delete snapshot without AMI then It can not Possible to delete snapshot
	
How to Use New Create Own AMI
	Instance -> My AMIs -> Select Own Create Instance
	If we change anything in this AMis then it is possible change lIke Type,Size etc..
