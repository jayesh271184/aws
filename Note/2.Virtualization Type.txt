Virtualization Type: (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/virtualization_types.html)
					It is a technique to create virtual Hardware.Implement with the help of hypervisor
						1) Hardware Virtual Machine (HVM)
						2) Para-Virtual (PV)
	Hypervisor :- Hypervisor are virtual machine monitor(VMM) that enables numerous virtual operating systems to 
	simultaneously run on a computer system.
	- The main differences between PV and HVM AMIs are the way in which they boot and whether they can take advantage
	of special hardware extensions (CPU, network, and storage) for better performance.
	- For the best performance, we recommend that you use current generation instance types and HVM AMIs when you 
	launch your instances.
	- Every physical machine has a hypervisor running on it. A Xen hypervisor allows multiple instances to share a 
	single hardware platform. A hardware on which a hypervisor is running one or more virtual machines is called a 
	Host machine. Each virtual machine is called a Guest machine.
	
1) HVM :- 
	- HVM AMIs are presented with a fully virtualized set of hardware and boot by executing the master boot record 
	of the root block device of your image.
	- This Virtualization type provides the ability to run an operating system directly on top of a virtual machine
	without any modification, as if it were run on the bare-metal hardware.
	- HVM guests can take advantage of hardware extensions that provide fast access to the underlying hardware on 
	the host system.
	- HVM AMIs are required to take advantage of enhanced networking and GPU processing. 
	- In order to pass through instructions to specialized network and GPU devices, the OS needs to be able to have 
	access to the native hardware platform; HVM Virtualization provides this access.
	- hardware provides support to run independently for each OS.
	- HVM AMIs support both Linux and Windows.
2) PV :-
	- PV AMIs boot with a special boot loader called PV-GRUB, which starts the boot cycle and then chain loads the 
	kernel specified in the menu.lst file on your image.
	- Paravirtual guests can run on host hardware that does not have explicit support for Virtualization, but they 
	cannot take advantage of special hardware extensions such as enhanced networking or GPU processing. 
	- Historically, PV guests had better performance than HVM guests in many cases, but because of enhancements in 
	HVM Virtualization and the availability of PV drivers for HVM AMIs, this is no longer true.
	- The ability of the guest kernel to communicate directly with the hypervisor results in greater performance 
	levels than other Virtualization approaches but they cannot take advantage of hardware extensions such as 
	enhanced networking,GPU etc.
	- The guest OS in this case is aware that it is virtualized. Para-virtualized AMIs support only Linux.
