SnowBall/AWS Snow Family 
	- Service Use for Data Migration
		On Premises to AWS
		AWS to On Premises
	- The AWS Snowball service uses physical storage devices to transfer large amounts of data between Amazon Simple 
	  Storage Service (Amazon S3) and your onsite data storage location at faster-than-internet speeds.
	- Snowball provides powerful interfaces that you can use to create jobs, track data, and track the status of your 
	  jobs through to completion.
	- Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure appliances to transfer large amounts 
	  of data into and out of the AWS cloud. Using Snowball addresses common challenges with large-scale data 
	  transfers including high network costs, long transfer times, and security concerns 
	- AWS Snowball, a part of the AWS Snow Family, is a data migration and edge computing device that comes in two options
	- Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices provide both block storage and Amazon S3-compatible object storage, and 40 vCPUs.
	- They are well suited for local storage and large scale-data transfer.
	- Snowball supports specific Amazon EC2 instance types and AWS Lambda functions, so you can develop and test in the AWS Cloud,
      then deploy applications on devices in remote locations to collect, pre-process, and ship the data to AWS.
	- Common use cases include data migration, data transport, image collation, IoT sensor stream capture, and machine learning.
	- AWS Snowball, a part of the AWS Snow Family, is an edge computing, data migration, and edge storage device that comes in two options. 
	- Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices provide both block storage and Amazon S3-compatible object storage, and 40 vCPUs.
	- They are well suited for local storage and large scale-data transfer. 
	- Snowball Edge Compute Optimized devices provide 52 vCPUs, block and object storage, and an optional GPU for use cases like advanced
  	  machine learning and full motion video analysis in disconnected environments.

AWS Snowball with the Snowball device has the following features:

	- 80 TB and 50 TB models are available in US Regions; 50 TB model available in all other AWS Regions.
    - Enforced encryption protects your data at rest and in physical transit.
    - There's no need to buy or maintain your own hardware devices.
    - You can manage your jobs through the AWS Snowball Management Console or programmatically with the job management API.
    - You can perform local data transfers between your on-premises data center and a Snowball. You can do these transfers 
	through the Snowball client, a standalone downloadable client. Or you can transfer programmatically using Amazon S3 REST 
	API calls with the downloadable Amazon S3 Adapter for Snowball. For more information, see Transferring Data with a Snowball.
    - The Snowball is its own shipping container, and its E Ink display changes to show your shipping label when the Snowball is 
	ready to ship. For more information, see Shipping Considerations for AWS Snowball.
