S3(Simple Storage Service)
	 - Amazon S3 is a service offered by AWS that provides object storage through a web service interface.
	 - Amazon S3 uses the same scalable storage infrastructure that Amazon.com uses to run its global e-commerce network
	 - Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time,
   	   from anywhere on the web.
	 - It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure 
	   that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites.
	 - This guide explains the core concepts of Amazon S3, such as buckets, access points, and objects, and how to 
	   work with these resources using the Amazon S3 application programming interface (API).
     - Simple Storage Service
	 - Backup,Snapshot stored in S3
	 - Scalable storage in the Cloud
	 - Migration is also use
	 - Download/upload Data here
	 - Static Website Hosting here
	 - Data Storage (Here Data stored is Based on Object)
	 - S3 is Object based Storage (IN EBS Block based Storage)
		In S3 Every File is act Like one Single Object ,It is not depend on file size its big or small file
		Like ., txt 
				mp3
				mp4
				bin
	 - If File is 10 kb/10mb/1Gb/10Gb all are is single object
	 - S3 is Provide container in container we stored our file
	 - S3 Provide Certain space in container in this space we have to stored our data this space is called Bucket
	 - In Bucket We have to stored our data
	 - Single Bucket size is 0-5 TB
	 - By-Default 100 Bucket Created by Single user/Account,If we have to Increase this Bucket then we can do this with the help of AWS
	 - Not Create in One Bucket into 2nd Bucket(Ek bucket k under dusri bucket nhi create kr sakte)
Properties of Bucket
	- Name must be unique
	- Static Website Hosting(Static means no any change in data)
	- Versioning 
			- If Not Enable then If you create one file and stored in Bucket then if you change the content of that file then 2nd time to stored this file on
			bucket then it can remove content of previous file and add new content of this file
			SIngle FIle Latest Version stored in Bucket If Not Enable Versioning
			- If Enable then It can stored the previous created file content & If Change the content of file then stored 2nd time then it can stored both file
			previous & Latest file.
			Multiple version stored in Bucket if Enable
	- Logs can be generated through Cloudwatch or this
	- Permission/policies-- Here we have to create Policy for who can access our bucket,Any Certain User or Certain Account to access bucket
	- Replication - It is One Type of Backup Replication Created Between Multiple Bucket.For Example If We Enable Replication in Bucket 1 with Bucket 2 then If upload any data in
	Bucket 1 then it can automatically upload in bucket 2 .
		If Bucket 1 closed then data already stored in bucket 2 then we can access through bucket 2
		If we upload File in Bucket 1 before Replication Enable that file not stored in bucket 2
		Before Replication enable uploaded file not stored in bucket 2,After Replication Enable then upload all file stored in bucket 2
		
 - S3 has one more feature for prise Control is called Storage Classes
	In which class you can stored your data
	Multiple Class is here	
	 1. Standard - If you have access Data & Perform any action on that data in Every 2-3 days then stored this data on Standard.
				   - Prise for storage is high & put/get(upload/download) file prise is low
				   
	 2. Standard Infrequant access - If you have access Data & Perform any action on that data in single time in 1 or 2 month then stored in this class
				   - Prise for storage is low compared to upload/download file
				   
	 3. One Zone IA- In this class data stored in single zone then if any issue in that zone then we have lost our data
				   
	 4. Glacier - If we access data on single time in 6 month or 1 year is stored here.Here data stored in compress & stored here
				- If we retrive data at that time we have to request for that & data receive after some time,Here data receive is approx some hours
				
	 5. Deep Glacier - Here also data stored in compress & stored,For retrive data it can get min 1 days to access 
				- Costing is very low but retrive time is very high
				
	 6. Intelligent Tiering - Here Create certain rule then apply this rule for bucket then bucket work on that rule
				- Like if we create some condition if no one access data in Standard class then data go to Standard Infrequant class then if not 
				  access that data then GOTO Glacier class like this we have to create rule for bucket
				  

	Except One Zone IA class all other classes All available zone then it can stored our data copy to another zone than if any issue at that
	time we can access our data with the help of different zone( Jitne bhi zone available hai us region me usme sab data ki ek copy rakhenge 
	so if ek zone down ho jaye to dusre me hum apna data check kr paye)


How to create S3

Old Method

	Service -> S3 -> Create Bucket
	1. Name and region
		Bucket name - Give name to Bucket
		Region - Select region
		Copy settings from an existing bucket
		Next
	2. Configure options
		Versioning - If Enable Versioning then tick here
		Server access logging - Tick if Log create,If tick then provide Target bucket and Target prefix
		Tags - FOr Identification give name to this
		Object-level logging - Tick if work through API in CloudFront in AWS,If Multiple service link with this then which service access through this bucket
						we have to check with this ,Generate log for this what service & how to service access,Provide full path for this how to service access
		Default encryption - Tick if encryption Enable for Object
		Advanced settings
			Object lock - If Tick then object Permanent stored in Bucket,then we can not delete object
		CloudWatch request metrics - Tick if Monitor requests in your bucket
	3. Set permissions - Here we have give bucket access permissions
						Multiple Policy show here tick as per requirement
		Next
	4. Review
	 Create Bucket

New Method

		Service -> S3 -> Switch to the new console -> Create Bucket
		General configuration
			Bucket name - Give name
			Region - Select region
		Bucket settings for Block Public Access
			Permission related show here
		Advanced settings
			Object Lock  - Select Enable or Disable
		Create Bucket
	In New Method It can not ask for Log or Versioning or Much more ,In New Method we can do more change after bucket create then we can change anything
	For this show video 03/04/2020 after 49:00 Minutes
	New Mathod is good for regular use bcz it can take Multiple feature for this we
		
After Create If you can upload Data on Bucket,Upload done then any one access to that data with the help of object link


********Rules for Bucket Name*****************
Bucket names must be between 3 and 63 characters long.

Bucket names can consist only of lowercase letters, numbers, dots (.), and hyphens (-).

Bucket names must begin and end with a letter or number.

Bucket names must not be formatted as an IP address (for example, 192.168.5.4).

Bucket names can't begin with xn-- (for buckets created after February 2020).

Bucket names must be unique within a partition. A partition is a grouping of Regions. AWS currently has three partitions: aws (Standard Regions), aws-cn (China Regions), and aws-us-gov (AWS GovCloud [US] Regions).

Buckets used with Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration can't have dots (.) in their names.
