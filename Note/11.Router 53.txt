Router 53
		- Route 53 is DNS service of AWS
		- Scalable DNS and Domain Name Registration
		- Route 53 Does not require region selection
	DNS :- Domain Name Server
		 - It can Convert IP to Name & Name to IP
		 - It give suitable name to IP Address
		 - www.google.com  --- FQDM(Fully Qualified Domain Name)
		 - DNS Work in 4 Small Step
			1. .(Root Server) 
				- Allover the World User can Purchase Domain then Its IP Stored is Here 
				- Allover World 13 root server available
			2. .com/.in/.tk.us  (TLD - Top Level Domain)
				- Then If you purchase .com then request go to .com server then search your Domain name or 
				  purchase .in then request go to .in server then search your domain 
				- Like If you type www.google.com then first go .com server & then serach google.com
				
			3. google.com/yahoo.in (Domain Name)
			4. www.google.com/image.google.com (Sub Domain)
		
		- If I Create New Site Like www.chintan.com If I Browse this site 1st time no one Browse this site then 1st It check into
		  cashe data of its own to check any data available for this site? due to 1st time Browse then not show any data then its
		  can go to its nearest ISP (Internet service providers) then it check any data available for this site? If find it data here 
		  then ok but if not find then go to 2nd ISP but it has no any data show here bcz no one Browse this site Bcz its new site
		- Then Finally go to root server then root server check domain name last its .com then tell to ISP .com IP then go to .com server
		  & find your name of domain name in TLD
		- After Receive IP then ISP go to .com server & Find name of chintan(Domain name) in .com server if domain name not found then tell
		  ISP domain name not exists
		- DOmain name exists then go to site & see all data for this site (If site name is www.chintan.com)
		- But if site name is like movie.chintan.com then it can find file name entry in domain name server & tell to find this server & access this file
		  then go to sub domain & see all content of data & Open Site
		- 1st time open site then if any other open this site then it can 1st check its check cashe data its not found then
		  go to ISP in ISP it give data for this site bcz already open earlier then it can directly open this site.
		- Like this DNS Work
	
******************************************** Feature of Route 53 ***************************************************

1. Domain Register  - Provide Domain Name through Route 53

2. Domain Hosting   - We have attach with resource(Like ELB,EC2 Instance,On-Premises Machine)
				    - Attach with Domain name then  Directly provide to CLient with help of Domain name
3. Routing Policies - Routing - It is Create Route between Source & Destination.
							  - How to request go to server here we mention 
					- Our Request how to go to Server (Kis tarah se hmri request server pr pohchegi wo batayenge)
4. Record Set Creation - 
					- IN google Search DNS Record types
						A (Host address) - IPv4 Address
					  	AAAA (IPv6 host address) - IPv6 Address
					  	ALIAS (Auto resolved alias) - Different name of Domain Provide here
						CNAME (Canonical name for an alias) - Already give name then here we have to bind resource with this name 
						MX (Mail eXchange) - For Main Server Configure
						NS (Name Server) - Where we have all our configuration done its call name server if any request receive it can receive through name server 
						PTR (Pointer) - IP to name conversion at that time use
						SOA (Start Of Authority) - It can show where is your domain host (If create in AWS then it can provide Name server & SOA )
	
	
*********************************************** Routing Policies ***************************************************

 - Six type of routing policies available here
	1. Simple routing Policy - Purchase Domain name & Attach Resource(EC2,ELB,etc..)
			- Any one go to domain name then it can see then content of already stored in server 
			- Single Domain can use only single server
	
	2. Latency routing Policy - Request receive from user at that time Who can Earlier to solve its request then divert its
			request to that Server(zone).(Jaha se iski Latency Low hogi vo server pr uski request ko divert kr dega)
			
	3. Geo-Location routing Policy - Here we have to mention our request receive from particular location then where it to divert
			- Particulate location se particulate server per request divert kr denga
			- Request Divert to particular location to particular server
	
	4. Weighted Routing Policy - Here we have to define how many percentage request go to this server & How many request go this server
			- Here We have define load divide into multiple server
 			- Here divide request with the reference of 254 that means it treat 254 = 100 then convert its % 
	
	5. Multi-Value Routing Policy - Same Domain name with multiple Entry (Same domain name k sath multiple entry kr sakte hai)
			- Same Domain name connect to different server or resource we can done here
			
	6. Fail-over Routing Policy - Here is Master-slave concept follow
			- Here we have to create one server to Master & another to Slave
			- Then if Any issue in Master server then all request divert to Slave server

How to Create Route 53

 Service -> route 53 -> DNS Management -> Get started now -> Create Hosted Zone (Here we have Entry Our Record Set,Resource & Domain Name Attach Here)
	Domain Name  - Give DOmain Name Already Purchase
	Comment - For Reference Type 
	Type - Public Hosted Zone - All over the World Access then select - Select this
		   Private Hosted Zone Amazon VPC - If work only in VPC then select
	Create it
	It can Provide 2 Record	
		1. Name Server(NS) - We have to Register All NS entry in Where we have to register our Domain(Jaha se Domain Name Purchase(Register) Krvaya hai waha pe iski entry krni padegi)
		2. Start of Authority (SOA) - It provide Where we have host our DNS
	Select Name Server(NS) & then Copy One-by-one & Paste into Domain Name Register Website as per Mention below.
		TTL(Time to Leave) Our Domain Name Entry How many Time Maintain in cache of Opposite machine(DOmain Name ki entry Kitne time tak samne vali machine k cache me rahegi) - Select 1 Minute
		After do this save record set
	Do TTL for above both service SOA & NS
	
		
	How to Register NS Entry in DOmain Server
		In Which Website we have to register Domain Open this Website & Select Domain Name 
		Select Manage Domain -> Management tools -> Nameservers -> Select Use custom nameservers -> Entry All Nameservers one by one

After Done this Process " Domain Name Host " Done
		
		
   - Launch 2 Instance Here create Mumbai region with SSH & HTTP Port Allow in Security Group & Type Script for HTTP Service Like Website Launch
   - Create Application Load Balancer Here create Mumbai region--With the help of DNS name we have to access Load Balancer
   - Launch 1 or 2 Instance in Different or Same region here create Ohio region with SSH & HTTP Port Allow in Security Group & Type Script for HTTP Service Like Website Launch

2. Weighted Routing Policy  - Divide the traffic according to which resource we have to access
							- Here we have create 2 record set with same name with different traffic percentage & Same DNS Name
							  so, we can divide traffic into 2 different region
							- It can use at that time when we have to move on to on-premises to AWS at that time we have use,
							  1st we have transfer 10 % if no any issue then then traffic 20...30..40.. 50.. & 100% traffic to
