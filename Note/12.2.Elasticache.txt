Elasticache	- Amazon ElastiCache works as an in-memory data store and cache to support the most demanding applications
              requiring sub-millisecond response times. 
			- By utilizing an end-to-end optimized stack running on customer dedicated nodes, Amazon ElastiCache 
			  provides secure, blazing fast performance.
			- Amazon ElastiCache is a fully managed in-memory data store and cache service by Amazon Web Services.
			- The service improves the performance of web applications by retrieving information from managed in-memory 
			  caches, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases.
			- Build data-intensive apps or boost the performance of your existing databases by retrieving data from 
			  high throughput and low latency in-memory data stores.

	- Cache - If User can search site first time then it can go to ISP & Search then retrive data & show site,
			  After search site browser store link or data for this site then 2nd time open this site then it cannot goto
			  ISP but last time store link or Data use this & retrive data its call cache
			- Here we create cache for Database
			- Here 2 Engine Available for this
				1. memcached
				2. redis
			- If multiple Request receive from Different Different Country at that time traffic maybe increase or some of the
			  user has Latency increase so it has many issue for access website Like load increase or failover chances is more 
			  for solution we have to use Elasticache
			- For Solution this we have to create Engine memcached or redis (Elasticache) then 1st time request receive then go 
			  to Main site & store link or data into Elasticache engine(memcached or redis) then 2nd request then request directly
			  go to the Elasticache engine & retrive data not go to main server so,Load decrease into main server & failover chances
			  reduce
			- 1. memcached - It is inpersistent - After sometime data remove
			  2. redis - It is persistent - Data may not remover after sometime
